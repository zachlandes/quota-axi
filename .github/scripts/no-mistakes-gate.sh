# Decides whether a pull request satisfies the "PR must be raised via no-mistakes"
# required check.
#
# A PR passes when any of these hold:
#   * its body carries the no-mistakes pipeline signature, or
#   * it was opened by dependabot[bot], or
#   * it is structurally a release-please release PR (see below).
#
# The release-please exemption is deliberately STRUCTURAL, never author identity.
# release-please opens quota-axi's release PRs as github-actions[bot] today, but
# exempting that login would exempt every other workflow-opened PR too, and would
# break the moment release-please is switched to a PAT and starts arriving as the
# human `kunchenguid`, who also opens ordinary human PRs.
#
# Every exemption lives here rather than in a job-level `if:` so the whole gate
# has one executable surface that tests can drive directly, and so the release
# workflow's status-stamping job can reuse the very same decision.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   PR_BODY, PR_AUTHOR, PR_NUMBER, PR_HEAD_REF, PR_HEAD_REPO, PR_BASE_REPO
# Exit status: 0 = pass, 1 = fail.
